# About me:
## My name is Tatiana Maysyuk. I was born and live in Belarus. I study at the Minsk State Linguistic University. I always strive to learn something new and learn something new. At the university, I specialize in computational linguistics, so I know some basic Python and Linux languages. But I decided to study something new, so I started taking these courses. I hope that at the end of these courses I will master new skills in programming languages. My strengths are that I can remain objective, stress-resistant, I am inquisitive. I'm always ready for something new.
